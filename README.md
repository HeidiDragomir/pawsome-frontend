Pawsome is the perfect place where you can find a paw friend, do some volunteering, create pet events or donate anything. Moreover you can ask anything if you have a problem or only need to know something related to your pet. Pawsome is like a pet friendly community where you can find help or just look to all adorable cats and dogs who would love to join to your family.

## General Information

- You can find live version here: [Pawsome](https://pawsome-fe.netlify.app/)
- and Backend Github Repository here: [Backend Github Repository](https://github.com/HeidiDragomir/pawsome-backend)


## Goals

There are too many cats and dogs who are looking after a temporary or a forever home, but helping them doesnâ€™t have to be complicated. I started with the idea to do an app where anyone can do more then to adopt a pet. This app is not enterly finished, the functionality could have more complexity, but my future plan is to come back to do this when I have more experience.

## Built with

-   [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
-   [React Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/)
-   [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
-   [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/)
-   [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

## Deployment

Frontend is deployed with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) and backend with [Render](https://render.com)'s free plan that automatically spun down after 15 minutes of inactivity. When a new request for a free service comes in, Render spins it up again so it can process the request. This can cause a response delay of up to 30 seconds for the first request that comes in after a period of inactivity.

## Code formatting & Naming conventions

I followed [this guide](https://vicvijayakumar.com/blog/eslint-airbnb-style-guide-prettier) as it is a requirement of the project.

| Name            | Example          | Usage                    |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| **kebab case**  | is-not-a-dish    | style classes            |
| **pascal case** | AllInOneCapitals | components, jsx pages    |
| **camel case**  | goesDownThenUp   | jsx variables, css files |
