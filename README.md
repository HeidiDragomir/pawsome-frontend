# Pawsome App <img src="icon.png" style="width: auto; height: auto; border-radius: 10px">

Pawsome is the perfect place where you can find a paw friend, do some volunteering, create pet events or donate anything. Moreover you can ask anything if you have a problem or only need to know something related to your pet. Pawsome is like a pet friendly community where you can find help or just look to all  adorable cats and dogs who would love to join your family.

## General Information

You can find live version here: [Pawsome](https://pawsome-fe.netlify.app/)

## Goals

There are too many cats and dogs who are looking after a temporary or a forever home, but helping them doesnâ€™t have to be complicated. I started with the idea to do an app where anyone can do more then to adopt a pet.  This app is not enterly finished, the functionality could have more complexity, but my future plan is to come back to do this when I have more experience.

## Built with

- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- [React Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

## Deployment


Frontend is deployed with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) and backend with [Render](https://render.com)'s free plan that automatically  spun down after 15 minutes of inactivity. When a new request for a free service comes in, Render spins it up again so it can process the request. This can cause a response delay of up to 30 seconds for the first request that comes in after a period of inactivity.

## Code formatting & Naming conventions

I followed [this guide](https://vicvijayakumar.com/blog/eslint-airbnb-style-guide-prettier) as it is a requirement of the project.

| Name        | Example          | Usage                             |
| ----------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **kebab case**  | is-not-a-dish    | style classes                     |
| **pascal case** | AllInOneCapitals | components, jsx pages             |
| **camel case**  | goesDownThenUp   | jsx variables, css files          |
